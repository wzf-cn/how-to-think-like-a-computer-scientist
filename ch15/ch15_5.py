q_5:
    Given four points that fall on the circumference of a circle, find the
    midpoint of the circle. When will this function fail?
    Hint: You must know how to solve the geometry problem before you think of 
    going anywhere near programming. You cannot program a solution to a
    problem if you donâ€™t understand what you want the computer to do!

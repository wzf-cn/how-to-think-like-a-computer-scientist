    Every week a computer scientist buys four lotto tickets. She always
    chooses the same prime numbers, with the hope that if she ever hits the 
    jackpot, she will be able to go onto TV and Facebook and tell everyone 
    her secret. This will suddenly create widespread public interest in prime 
    numbers, and will be the trigger event that ushers in a new age of 
    enlightenment. She represents her weekly tickets in Python as a list 
    of lists:
    my_tickets = [[ 7, 17, 37, 19, 23, 43],
                  [ 7,  2, 13, 41, 31, 43],
